Prompt:

2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 
to 10 without any remainder.

What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the 
numbers from 1 to 20?


Thoughts:

My initial attempt simply tests the divisibility of a given starting number by 
all numbers 2 to 20 which works for 2520 but takes very long (> 5 minutes) for
larger least common multiples. Yes, this problem is about least common 
multiples. It requires a writeup of one of the common algorithms to determine
the LCM of multiples. These are the greatest common divisor method and the
prime factors method. Read about it on Wikipedia.
