Euler Problem 3
---------------
Prompt:

The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29. What is the largest prime 
factor of the number 600851475143?

Thoughts:

Learning vim is confusing.

About the problem... After doing some reading (read: cheating) online I
found a solution specific to the problem that looks for the first prime
factor (71 in this case) then takes the multiplicand as the new number to
be factored (reducing the search space significantly). I generalized and
cleaned up this process by using the upper bound for the initial range to
be examined as sqrt(n) and made it easier for me to understand by making a
list of all of the prime factors. I use the most naive primality test
possible but the script still runs very fast.

Note: in Python 2.X range produces a list while xrange produces a sequence.
This is the reason my initial attempt (which used range) produced a buffer
overflow (memory) error.
