Euler Problem 3
---------------
Prompt:

The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29. What is the largest prime 
factor of the number 600851475143 ?

Thoughts:

My initial attempt is below.

def isprime(n):
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n%i == 0:
            return False
    return True

number = 600851475143
primeFactors = []
for j in range(2, number):
    if number % j == 0 and isprime(j):
        primeFactors.append(j)
        
This produced a memory error, due to the size of the number. My method is
likely very inefficient. It appears I will have to implement a version of
Eratosthenes' Sieve... or something.
