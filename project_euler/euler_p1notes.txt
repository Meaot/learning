Euler Problem 1
---------------
Prompt:

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, 
we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of 
all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

Thoughts:

I ran p1a the first time and got 266333. Submitted it and found it was wrong.
Confused, I made p1b and used the modulo (%) method (Which I had thought about
in bed before going to sleep a few nights earlier but forgotten about. Then I
searched Google and looked at a method of doing the problem computationally and
once I saw the modulo sign I made my own attempt at it). Still getting 266333. 
Then I started p1c using the for-loop and upon working out how to use 'or'
(the version online used || in a different language) realized that I was double
counting multiples of both 3 AND 5. This is the key in the wording that is
crucial. Once I corrected that and got p1c running, I got the correct answer,
233168.

I then went back and added a for-loop to remove multiples of both 3 and 5 from
one of the 2 lists. In addition, a bit earlier while working in p1b, I used
append instead of extend to add new values to the list of multiples.
